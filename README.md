# Protocol for monitoring stem water content in trees using FDR/TDR sensors

Trees and whole forest ecosystems are becoming increasingly exposed to droughts under climate change. Accurate capture of vegetation water content will substantially advance how we quantify drought stress and related mortality risk in trees. In our latest publication, we established a first generic relationship between stem water content and dielectric permittivity in woody tissue, using electromagnetic sensors. This protocol is designed to facilitate the installation of electromagnetic sensors for monitoring tree water content at high temporal resolution. Here, you will be able to find a detailed description of the installtion procedure (a list of DOs and DON'Ts), the right tools needed for installation & data processing scripts written in R-language, using calibration equations (especially the slope) derived from Martius et al., 2024.
